<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Rock Paper Scissors contains images from various hands, from different races, ages, and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labeled as such. You can download the training set here and the test set here. I created these images using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a model trained on a CGI-based dataset could classify real images. I also generated a few pictures that you can use for predictions. You can find them here.

Note that all of these pictures use a plain white background. Each image is 300Ã—300 pixels in 24-bit color. Examples Here are a few examples showing some of the poses and the diversity of hands used.
